/**
 * Memory of sixty four 16-bit registers (64 registers, each 16-bit wide).
 * If load is asserted (load=1), the value of the register selected by
 * address is set to in (that us, the in value is loaded into the memory
 * location specified by the address); Otherwise, the value does not change.
 * The value of the selected register is emitted by out
 * (after the next time step).
